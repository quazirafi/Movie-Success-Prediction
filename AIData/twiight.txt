the movie twilight is nothing like the book
Actually Eclipse was horribly bad. New Moon has been the only one closet to the book
Twilight is laughably bad now after reading/watching hunger games
They should have let me direct the movie
This movie fucking sucks ! Couldn't watch the whole movie with my eyes open.
geez, 'Kiss me'... how fucking less romantic could she have make it? it hurts when I watch it. her only line that killed me a bit more was the first part's 'You are beautiful'. like, seriously, what's wrong with her

Horrible actors in this movie.
