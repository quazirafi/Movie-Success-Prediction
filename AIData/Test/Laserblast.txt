I could go on, but I've already put more creativity into this review than the movie had. And I'm not creative.
I'd give it negative stars if possible.
I must give special mention to the movies musical score. The music in Laserblast really adds a level of class to proceedings which in all fairness probably doesn't deserve to be there. That main theme over the credits really is great sci-fi music.
I swear every time I see that Star Wars billboard get blown up I almost wet myself. What more can you ask of cheap Sci-Fi than Laserblast? I think if you consider the general aesthetic of the seventies, you will see that this is the ULTIMATE 70's movie. I regret never seeing it at a drive in.
As I saw that, I was stunned. Leonard Maltin rates movies on a scale of one to four. I'll give it 2 1/2 stars out of ten, maybe. The plot is stupid and full of holes.
I am one of those few who liked this movie. I was always reluctant to get this on DVD, but during a Full Moon Valentine's Day Sale, I bought it. 
i must be out of my mind giving this movie a rating a 10 out of 10 stars. people might say that i'm crazy, but i realize why Leonard Maltin decide to give this movie a rating 2 1/2 stars for this movie. it's not really bad at all.
Camp: the absurdly ludicrous, the ludicrously absurd. This movie wasn't meant to be taken seriously. It did have some bizarre creatures & stop-motion animation.
This may well be the worst movie ever made. It has no perceptible story line, very little, if any plot, and some really poor acting. I can't think of a single positive thing to say about it at all, really, and I have no idea at all why I sat through the whole thing, but I did, and didn't feel cheated at the end, which I also cannot explain.
This movie is seriously confusing, scenes that don't seem to belong together follow each other without transition or explanation. Who are these people? Why are they here? What i going on? No one knows. On top of that, the special effects are laughable, the characters are ill defined and the acting is bad.
Confused yet?
Don't bother trying to understand what's going on in this movie, it will just make your head hurt. No good acting, I don't even think it was directed, and written by a chimp with ADD. Do not watch without the safety net of MST3K.
