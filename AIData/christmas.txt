This doesn´t looks like a movie, it looks like a SHITTY COMMERCIAL. The dislike bar is Extremely Big, i´ve never seen a dislike bar like this, In the like/dislike bar, Only the 6.18% are likes LOOOOOOL.
this movie is the lowest rated movie in history according to IMDB, so i'm not wasting my time
fuck shit
Not only is this movie of extremely poor quality in terms of film making, but it is also spreading false information. The origins of Christmas are pagan. It was meant as a celebration of the winter solstice. Many many years ago it was adopted by Christians and celebrated together by all people, non-Christians and Christians alike. That's why there's the Christmas tree and gifts and Santa Clause. These are all of pagan origin. It is not and never was Christian holiday, thus it can't be saved or taken back, as it was stolen by Christians in the first place. In other words, this movie is horseshit
It looks like not even the actors want to be in this movie. Or they just suck hairy balls at acting
That trailer was painful.
This movie looks so freaking boring
Just saw this for the first time. What the fuck did I just saw!
What the hell is this shit?
Looks like shit
