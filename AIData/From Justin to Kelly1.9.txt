And I only watched the first 25 minutes. It is inconcievable to me that anyone could make a film this hopelessly, endlessly, mind-meltingly bad. This is not a bad movie - it's a war crime. Somehow the producers actually managed to cast supporting players bad enough to make Kelly Clarkson and even the talent free Justin Guarini seem good by comparsion.
Yes, it finally came on cable. And, in order to keep up my credentials as an expert on badfilm, I had to deal with this monstrosity sooner or later. So, without further ado... 
IMDb should consider creating a "0" rating below the current "1". The description should read "dreadful".
There are bad movies. There are really bad movies. And then there's this one.
A quick note on the musical numbers: you have a mute button. Employ it LIBERALLY. Thank you.
This is a poor attempt to capitalize on the popularity of the American Idol show. Unfortunately they chose to use the people rejected from the show as cast. Save the ticket fee this one comes out on video in July. Or you can keep an eye on the Late, Late, Late Show, you will see this one with its twin Glitter.
OK, now that the court case is over (verdict: accidental self-mutilation), we can confess. We did it as a joke, really. Our friend had said that he thought "Troll 2" was "OK," so we switched that DVD out for "From Justin to Kelly," just for a giggle. I mean, how were we to know? 
When I sat down to watch From Justin to Kelly, I knew it had a not so kind reputation among IMDb. It has an incredibly low rating and is in the Bottom 100.
In the 1,516 seasons of American Idol, I have yet to see more than a 30-second clip or ad for the show. I wonder if that show's as bad as From Justin to Kelly.
This movie truly makes me want to say: REALLY? out loud and very loud. The music is terrible, the choreographed dances amateurish, the story nonexistent, the plot unoriginal, the chemistry vacant and worst of all……..Justin's hair.
