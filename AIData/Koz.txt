This shameful movie is about how government of Turkey is run by idealist. Which in fact is a murderer and a dictator. Shame on anybody who watches this crap.
A really horrible film which only aims to increase support for the idiotic things the government did and will do.
Really awful. Don't waste your time. if even they give you money to watch it you will regret and you will never take back that hours from your life. You will suffer and suffer.
This is presumably the worst propaganda film ever shot in the entire history of cinema.Do not ever spend your precious time to see this rubbish film!
curse words This is such a shitty movie for several reasons: * This movie is produced only to lie about AKP government's false policies, theft and murders
To sum up, this is not a movie. THIS IS JUST A BULLSHIT!
This movie is one of the worst movies I have ever watched. It is an analogous to Adolf's "Mein Kampf".
I give this film one star this will be an insult for the films which deserve one star. This is the worst and most disinformatic film I ever watched in my life.
If anybody is curious about this movie and wonders why there are so many negative comments about it, that's because it's the "WORST" movie ever, I mean it. It's completely waste of time, 
Since this movie has the lowest rating at the time being, there's no need to write a pages of review, is there?
