I cried watching this movie...thank God for this female police officer...that she had the patience to listen to this child and ask the right questions. This movie was amazing!
Just finished the book. It was amazing haha now about to watch the movie
And this is why i gave up on trailers. It was a great movie but this trailer should have shown just a bit of the story.
After watching this trailer I was unsure, it looked too forced and predictable. However, I read some comments saying to just watch it, don't think, watch. And OMG! This was one of the best movies I've ever seen. I never cry, and I cried throughout! Holy sxht, just watch it!!!!! Buying the book tomorrow, the author is an absolute genius. The movie finished an hour ago and my throats still tight. Amazing!
I saw the movie yesterday without knowing anything about it. Then today I saw this trailer. The commenters are right. This trailer gives away the whole movie, which could cause some to not watch it, because they already know what is going to happen, that they get free. I'm glad I didn't know anything about it, because I was captivated so much I was balling my eyes out throughout the whole movie. I'm still emotional about it a day later, and probably will be for a while. That's how great this move is. It draws you in, especially the way that Jack describes his world, both in the Room, and outside the Room.
I love it... I love... I just love this movie!
I CRIED OUT WHILE WATCHING THIS TRAILER... I'VE NEVER GOT THIS FEELING BEFORE.
The book was amazing. Now I just need to see this and I will be satisfied with my life.
it was a beautiful movie !!
I got to watch this on my flight yesterday, it really is such a good film, the boy is amazing.
