I want my 90 minutes back.
AWFUL!!! If ever there was a case for barring someone from the film industry, this piece of trash is it. Money DOES NOT equate talent (or common sense in the case of Hilton).
I am just amazed that (as of this moment) there are 554 people who rated this movie a 10...  I would like 10 pounds or 20 gallons of whatever it is that has warped their mentality to such a degree...  Acting - Abysmal to Non-existent... Script - Huh? Wazzat? Directing - Not that I saw. My only regret is that I cannot vote less than 1... Although I must say that I am quite satisfied that this flick has rocketed to the numero uno spot of the bottom 100...
This Is So Not Hot.
Seriously, this movie actually got better when I remembered my wife carried pepper spray in her purse, and I dug it out and sprayed myself in the face until the canister was empty.
Of course, everyone, like myself, will have to see for themselves. But this movie is not worth the time. It's just annoying and banal.
I think it says a lot about this film that Paris Hilton is amongst the better performers. The actor she's playing opposite has slightly less emotional depth than a block of wood and seems to be reading his lines off cue cards held over other performers' shoulders.
Unless you like cruelty to people who aren't as distinguished as you are, or stress the fact that "Girls, if you want to look good for your Boy, surgery is the best way to go," which is terrible to even consider even as a moral, then go ahead and see this movie.
It's hard to ignore the camera work that used all sorts of filters to make the very average looking Paris into the "hotty". She is average looking at best at her current age even with special effects.
One of the worst films I have ever seen. How Paris Hilton does movies, I will never know.
