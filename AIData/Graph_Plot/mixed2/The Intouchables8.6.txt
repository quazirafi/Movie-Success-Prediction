One of the Most Unique and Beautiful Friendships ever Committed to Film
You've seen it, or you haven't. It's monumental and outrageously good.
Probably the best French film for years
This movie surprised us. We checked on IMDb and saw 8/10 for a french movie, without hesitation we went to the movie theatre to watch the movie.
And yes, it's one of the best French films ever, and certainly one of the best of 2011.
It is also a good film for teenagers as it holds a few wonderful life lessons.
I cannot say more; the film must be experienced. My friends tried, they failed, so I trusted them and I saw it. It floored me. Go and be floored. 
If you want to watch and enjoyable comedy, with very touching moments, this is a must go.
What makes the quality of the film, beside the humour present in every scene in which Omar Sy appears (actually most of the film), is the emotion you can feel, through increasingly attaching characters.
