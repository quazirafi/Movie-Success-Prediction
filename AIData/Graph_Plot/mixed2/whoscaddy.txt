This is Norbit, Soul Plane, and The Cookout in a bucket, thrown up on. There is no reason to make such a movie. It will win no awards and it's only purpose is to fill the 7 dollar DVD bin at Wal-Mart. 
Cast your mind back to 1980, with a movie called Caddyshack. You might possibly have heard of this movie, as it's one of the best comedies of all time, backed with a stellar lineup (at the time) of top notch comedy actors.
Absolute garbage. There is NO effort whatsoever to make Who's Your Caddy unique enough (or funny enough) to step away from Caddyshack's shadow. What was once fresh and unique, has become standard and staid, and as Who's Your Caddy copied a 27 year old movie wholesale, making the jokes so obvious you already know the punchline while the directors are in the setup. 
If you want to watch a funny golf movie, Watch Caddyshack, or if you're desperate, Caddyshack II. If you've seen them both before, then just fondly re-watch them, as your memories will be forever tainted if you what this shameful, shallow, remake.
Guys I saw the movie and I just didn't like it, it didn't have anything to do with the racism or the bad acting I just didn't like it, reason being is that the jokes were old and I already knew them all, nothing new was thrown in there that could make me laugh even once, it felt more awkward and embarrassing instead of funny.
I saw this movie in theaters on its opening night because I thought the trailer made it look funny. When I sat down right before the previews started I thought about it and I had only seen the trailer for this movie twice. And no other marketing besides that; I now know why. 
To summarize buy this movie at the 3.99 Walmart bin if a friend you haven't seen in years invites you to his birthday party or something.
yet again i wish IMDb had a 0/10 ranking. my little brother made the mistake of renting this title from a red-box using a promo code. i was upset realizing that although the rental was free,
which i had no desire in seeing. i regret seeing this movie and feel empty realizing that watching this probably did more damage to my body than my smoking habit.
This movie is one of a kind and even that is too big of a compliment for this seriously lackluster movie. It tries to be funny and thoughtful and ends up being incredibly and offensively stupid, racist, and trite.
