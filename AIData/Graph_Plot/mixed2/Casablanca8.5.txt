So whatever films will come, how many sequels will overflow the screen, and how much junk we will have to sit through, one thing is certain if we're desperate to see a great film: We'll always have Casablanca!
you may see it as a romance, or as a story of intrigue, but that is only partially correct.
I've loved this film for thirty years.
Seeing it for the first time is truly the start of a romance with ideals that will live in you long after credits end.
Amazing cast, memorable dialogue, unforgettable story. Through this film, Casablanca will always live in my heart and I will think of its characters as family.
Of all the classics in all the films in all the world, this is the best!
Play it again and again and again and again, Sam.
Even though such trickery as midget airport workers, fog machines and cardboard cutout airplanes were utilized, this film convinces through its beautiful story with many layers, and characters that are so well realized.
I must confess that I have seen this picture so many times that I can recite every single line in the movie to the consternation of my wife who can't watch it with me anymore. 
While every person in the film becomes a real flesh and blood presence, the story of Rick and Ilsa is the center of this cinema feast.
