As far back as I can remember, I've always wanted to be a gangster.
Anyway, "Goodfellas" has to be one of the best films I've ever seen--a true modern classic that will be remembered for what it is: One of the greatest tales told on screen. It's an offer you can't refuse!
If there was one word that I could use to describe Martin Scorsese's "Goodfellas": it'd be priceless.
There isn't a single moment in the movie where it doesn't miss a beat, you could only tell by the atmosphere of the time period and it seems so real.
In one word: perfection
The greatest mob film still today
A masterpiece exposing misguided loyalties and greed
This is the gangster film at its finest. Scorsese is on top form as are Pesci and De Niro. Liotta has never bettered the performance he gives here.
"GoodFellas" may be the most important film of the 1990s in the fact that its incredible success led to some of the other great movies of the decade.
Simply a masterpiece. Scorsese's last truly great movie (to date).
