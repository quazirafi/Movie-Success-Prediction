Superb acting on top of brilliant storytelling
Martin Scorsese Hits the Streets Again!
Over all I am very MAD. MAD at the people who say this movie is brilliant.
It is brilliant only because the original is brilliant and they had taken almost every element of it.
The Departed lacked in that department. There's no connection between the two main characters except for the fact they are moles. They're almost portrayed as black and white. Especially Damon who doesn't seem to have any nuance. He's just bad till the end.
Whatever I say does not do this film justice
Get the original out instead. Please. You won't regret it.
This is one of the most entertaining and suspenseful crime/drama's I have seen in a while.
I think The Departed expands on it in so many ways.
The film would have been much stronger with unknowns in several key positions, and for me once the disparate strands were established the rest of the film was very predictable and I wasn't kept guessing - crucial if we are to suspend disbelief and have pressure and tension build in the viewer.
