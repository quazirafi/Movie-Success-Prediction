7 years later and it's still the best movie in its genre﻿
This is still ,by far, my favorite movie of all time.﻿
His acting is still fucking spectacular, and everyone knows who I'm talking about. He's why we are all still here﻿
Good Luck Jared Leto﻿
THE best movie i have ever seen.﻿
As long as this movie exists I don't give a flying fuck about Batman v. Superman﻿
Do you think it's the best movie you have ever seen ?﻿
I wish I could go back in time to watch this movie for the first time again﻿
What a shame. If Heath Ledger was alive, he would be awesome in Suicide Squad.
BEST . BATMAN . MOVIE . EVER.﻿
