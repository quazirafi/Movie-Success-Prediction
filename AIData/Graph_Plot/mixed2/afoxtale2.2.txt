In spite of the new project had enough money, the quality of graphic is ridiculous in 2008. Not just the scenes and characters are obsolete, but the animation of characters is unnatural and amateurish. 
Don't be mistaken, it is simply not a movie to watch, its sole purpose was described above. Frankly, it still has a positive side: so very filled with primitive errors that you definitely not want to commit if you ever make animated films that you can actually learn from it.
Truly a visual poison, should be forbidden to minors, its not made for them. It is made for the money, and the money only.
...and now, something completely different: the same nightmare with English voices: This so-called CG-movie is just not what it seems. 
Okay, since no one has commented on this movie yet, I grab the opportunity to be the first.
And rightly so. This movie is just a blatant disgrace, especially if we consider that the original Vuk was so dear to so many people. It's nothing more but a shameful ripoff, a steal of state sponsorship money and it's a disgrace to the creators of the original movie.
Really not much more left to mock about this title, but because it's a fine tutorial how NOT to make a film (or anything else!), I think, I should gather the scraps and flush them too down the toilet.
First of all, this movie is at the bottom 100 at IMDb already, but with the Hungarian name 
Anyone forcing/allowing her/his child to see this "thing" should be executed immediately.
Your DS or PSP has WAY better graphics, animation, effects, voices, sound and everything than this.
