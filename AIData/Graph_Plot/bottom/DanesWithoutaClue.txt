This is without a doubt the worst Danish movie I have ever seen. Even the two main actors, Timm Vladimir and Gordon Kenedy did not attend the opening of the movie as they disliked the result - and only 4000 people saw it in the theatres.
The movie was initiated without the screen play being completed, and the result is not surprisingly a movie with no plot, based around the two "superstars", Jim and Morten.
This movie definitely deserves to be in the top of the IMDb bottom 100.
Timm & Gordon have publicly said, that they are so embarrassed about this movie. They even warned people to see it.
This is ultimately the worst movie I have ever wasted my time on. I only saw it, because I heard so many say that it was the most terrible movie ever to come out of Denmark. And boy they where right.
Horrible movie in every single aspect of film making. There's absolutely NOTHING good about this. When I first heard about it, and how bad it was, I thought there might be a chance that it could be a "so bad it's funny movie", but it's not.
Totally unfunny "comedy" starring stand up comedians Timm & Gordon as two braindead tv-stars out to make a movie. The laughs are non-existent in this mercifully short, but boring mega-bomb, which was deservedly ignored at the box office, released on video shortly after its brief theatrical runnings. Hard to tell who gives the worst performance here, but who cares anyway?
This movie so thoroughly deserves being on the TOP 100 of the worst movies ( or bottom 100 depending on how you look at it )
It REALLY stinks. The only thing I find amusing about this movie is that even Gordon Kennedy , one of the lead actors, said in an interview that he wished he had never made that movie and warned people against seeing it.
This is the ultimate bad movie and that's all that has to be said. This can be documented by looking at how many people actually saw this film. I can't tell the exact number, but it was something between 1000 and 1500.
Everything there is to say about this film has already been said: It sucks. It really, truly sucks. There is nothing funny what so ever about this movie. I was bored out of my mind when I watched it.

There is no way a professional scriptwriter could write such a peace-of-crap manuscript, without noticing that something (or everything) was wrong
Knowing that this is one of the worst movies of all times, we had great expectations when one of our tv-channels for some reason showed this piece of art yesterday.
After 45 minutes we all fell asleep, me, my wife and my kids.
I have watched this movie, and I have actually watched it more than once. The first time I saw the whole movie, but since I have watched parts of the movie two or three times.
I agree with the people who say this movie is a piece of crap, but I wouldn't call it the worst movie ever.
