Anyone who would remotely consider themselves to be a fan of the spoof genre would reject this trash. I'll be the first one to admit that taste is subjective, but the guys that made this movie lack any sort of talent for this type of movie
A dismal failure of a spoof with only the slightest bit of funny. This dreck breaks all the rules of good spoofing.
