As a golden rule, never watch a movie with Mehmet Ali Erbil. He is not a good actor, has no comedic talent beyond fart jokes, and no sense of appropriateness or decency. 
What's the worst movie you've ever seen in your life? Just lie back and think about it. Do you think it's really bad? No! Forget about it. If you really wanna see a bad movie, you have to watch this. 
although main character mehmet ali is a talented actor, he has chosen the worst and easiest way to act in this film. he thinks that this is the right way to reach out to millions but no, not in this film and the last 5 films he has done. i think this is another film which is made just to earn money and pay for his gambling habit. 
First of all, Petek Dinçöz is not actress. She is not singer neither. So, why she plays in this movie? Actually the answer is money. If Dinçöz play in this movie and introduce parts of her body to us and for "art",our wise people will not watch the movie. 
Before I have seen the movie, I thought that it was gonna be a fun movie but I am totally disappointed. The movie sucks!!! It was a terrible terrible version of SHREK with no script at all. 
There were very good actors with a little appearance and almost no lines. Instead of watching this movie, go find to do something else. Believe me whatever you choose, 
I haven't. It's just a waste of time. From time to time this Mehmet Ali Erbil man comes from nowhere with such stupid movies and takes away all the enthusiasm of the hard working cinema lovers. 
The worst scene involves a massacre over some big stair steps at some weird beach, and a baby cradle falls down. Is that bizarre or what?
It's silly, it's quirky, it's Turkish and I like it.
The previous commenter seems to have either not understood what the movie was about or has an awful humor. However, this movie won't win any prizes, but if you take it as a comedy which parodies the style of fairy tales, it is quite entertaining.
