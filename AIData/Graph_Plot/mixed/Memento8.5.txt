Thank Goodness I didn't read the reviews posted before I saw the film!! Most reviews (including ones on this site) will tell you waaayyyy too much about the movie, and that's just plain frustrating. But, as an avid cinephile, I promise not to do the same.
Only go to the official website AFTER you've seen the movie. It too will give too much away. Afterwards, though, go and look at it--it's pretty impressive.
An unforgettable trip into the mind of a man with no memory
This film will leave its own memento on your mind, and you'll have a hard time forgetting how much you enjoyed it.
One of the most "memorable" (sorry, couldn't help slipping in the bad joke) films you're likely to ever see.
"Memento" is an instant classic due to its groundbreaking narrative style and impressive dramatic undertones.
So the "innovative" concept of filming out of sequence has been cliche for at least a few years now, but here's a film that makes it work far better than its been shown in a while.
Overall I left the film trying to figure out what was what, and I'm still not sure. This film noir concept shouldn't work, but it does so wonderfully.
While many might find the movie rather confusing, it flows wonderfully for anyone familiar with writing styles that constantly jump around a timeline
Confusion, uncertainty, and paranoia as an art form: possibly.
