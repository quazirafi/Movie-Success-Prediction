Cinema lovers and casual movie goers, I believe will enjoy this film.
I can watch this film again and I actually can't wait until it hits distribution.
I did not expect the film to be so powerful for me. Expectations exceeded.
Best film of the decade.
The film ended in a big round of applause from the packed theater and I am sure that will be the case a long time from now!
There is so many excellent great things to say about this film.
Wow just wow. Easily one of the greatest films of the year
One last thing if this gets attention in wide release this could see a heightened interest in Jazz, this is certainly a film that can make even the not-so musically inclined want to throw on a Jazz record and just drown in it.
Pay no attention to this review, because almost everybody loves this movie.
The music, when it's actually music, is well-chosen and well-performed.
