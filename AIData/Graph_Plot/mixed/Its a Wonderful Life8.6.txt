Makes me feel good to be alive. What a wonderful little world it is. And if I waited my entire life, it would not be a waste of time.
A Great Influence.
A Wonderful Film and Timeless Classic
This film has become a Christmas tradition in my family. We watch it every year and never tire of it.
After strong performances in films such as "Mr Smith Goes to Washington" and "The Philadelphia Story", James Stewart confirmed his status as one of the greats with his performance as George Bailey in "It's a Wonderful Life". This movie is, without a doubt, the best of all time.
IT'S NOT OFFICIALLY CHRISTMAS SEASON UNTIL I WATCH THIS MOVIE
A wonderful film that should be watched again and again.
However, it is a beautiful film, and is one of the few that you can watch again and again and walk away with the same glowing feeling as you did when you first watched it.
Best feel good movie ever? Quite possibly.
And that universal lesson will be taught into eternity as long as It's A Wonderful Life is shown every year. Wouldst we all learn it.
