Really awful. Don't waste your time. Even if they give you money to watch it you will regret it and you will never take back that hours from your life. You will suffer and suffer.
I wrote this review and I'm still in pain because I've seen this movie . Seriously physically pain it hurts and I need healing asap.
If there was one movie that seems like total commerce, this is absolutely it. A bunch of German Youtubers get together to make unfunny jokes and money.
he basic story is explained quickly. A loser called "Leo" tries to become the new hero of his school when a mysterious virus appears. Summary: Unfunny jokes, very weak story, bad acting from "youtubers". Absolutely not recommend.
There are many comedy movies in Germany that are just plain awful, unfunny and unnecessary. And what can I say about this one ? Its plain awful, unfunny and unnecessary. 
Voting: 1/10 Really bad stuff I cant understand when someone would laugh about that.
Why did I gave the movie just 1 Point? The main reason for it, is the mindless story, the bad humor and the incredible awful screen play of the actors. Even the other German comedians, who came to aid Otto, disappointed. Everything they where able to accomplish , was to warm up old jokes from the 90s. 
To begin with there are plenty of Youtubers which produce great content, like TotalBiscuit, Jesse Cox, Gimmeaflakeman; Jim Sterling and many others and then there are the others,
If you want to spend your time doing something meaningful go watch some paint dry or just watch out of the window at 3 a.m. Believe me, it's more fun than this steaming pile of horse dung!
A flat plot line combined with bad acting and horrible jokes. This movie isn't even worth watching for free. If you pay money for it (like i did), i am very sorry, because there are 7 billion people who deserve these
