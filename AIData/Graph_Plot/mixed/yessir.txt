Imitating the Police Academy series of 1980s' this film is just complete nonsense. The worst performances of all Turkish comedians come together at this no-plot and strained drama.
It would surely be a waste of time to watch this film. After the introduction of the characters, the rest of the movie is absolutely unbearable and pesky.
Basically this movie is for mentally deficient individuals who watch movies and understand nothing. Don't ever watch this if you are reading this critic and understand what i am saying. 
This is wrong on so many levels.
Why would anyone torture themselves with this? I have seen better films come from kids with camera-phones (no joke).
At a time when Turkey should be investing in their movie industry so that the country can produce the fine works of art that it has done in the past, $500,000 was spent on this steaming pile of camel crap.
Call me old fashioned but I like a movie that is believable, with good characters and a plot line that I can follow, this has absolutely none of these.
I would love to tell you what this film was about but I just have no idea.You have been warned.

If you are looking for a good mentally disordered movie; see "House of Fools"(2002) instead. It's so emotional and touching, also originally funny and smart. House of Fools was directed by Andrei Konchalovksy.
