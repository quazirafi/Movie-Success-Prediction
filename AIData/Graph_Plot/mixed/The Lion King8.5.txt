The Best Animated Film I Have Ever Seen.
I rank this animated film among the great films I have ever seen. It was part of my childhood and it is a film experience I will never forget. And hopefully, you won't either. A++
The Lion King is a great film. Along with a great story (inspired by William Shakespeare's Hamlet), terrific animation, and an all star cast of voices, there are the lessons that are learned from this film (despite being a little rough for the younger children). Like responsibility and honor.
This is a film that can entertain anyone young or old, I usually don't care for animated movies but this film is the real deal, this is one of disney's best animated movies.
One of my favorite movies of all time!
This is truly one of the best Disney movies ever.
I really enjoyed it when I first seen it, about when I was 6, and since then I watched it over and over again.
I simply LOOOOVED the music.
It's one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard.
And, speaking of soundtrack, I just can't tell in words how much I love the song "Can You Feel The Love Tonight".
