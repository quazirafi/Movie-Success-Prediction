If I could give this movie a ratings less than 1 I would. This is coming from someone who LIKES fairly terrible movies. I watched Dorm Daze and thought it was mildly amusing. I watched Britney Spears in Crossroads for gods sake.
his is what I believe that the movie is about: Paris Hilton is the head of some girl sorority, her biggest dream is to be on the cover of FHM (soft-playboy) and now she has her chance. 
This movie has no logic, actually not even scenes that fit together, it is for no one that isn't IN puberty, the few laughs you'll get is when the movie makes so little sense that it's actually funny. 
The director should be ashamed to have put his name on something so ridiculous and tacky.. Somehow I don't think an Oscar is on the cards for this guy.
Don't waste time on this... No matter what you do...
I have often used the phrase the worst movie I have ever seen when describing a movie that I did not enjoy. That was until I saw Pledge This. ever since then I have been unable to say worst movie ever because I know that it wasn't as bad as this one.
Never recommended, to anyone. Rate - 0. But since here is 1 as the lowest, I give it a 1.
The acting is terrible, and Paris Hilton's voice-over is annoying at best, and sometimes ambiguous about whose voice-over it actually is. There is barely any continuity between scenes, and major plot points are often introduced but then mysteriously forgotten forever by the next scene. 
This was just a pathetic ego booster for Paris Hilton as far as I can see who obviously is believing her own hype.
There is nothing right with this film. The acting is appalling (even Paula Garces whom I normally like) the script seem to have been written by a bunch of pubescent 14 year old boys and in what film EVER have you seen the "baddie" given an narrative voice-over???
