"He who saves a single life, saves the world entire."﻿
One of the Best Movies Ever!!!!!!!!!﻿
Best movies of all time ...﻿
Man, after this movie I absolutely fell in love with Liam Neeson...﻿
Best shit ever caught on camera﻿
I first watched this is an ELA class in highschool as part of learning the various forms of literatures and media inspired by the holocaust, and it exceeded my expectations, especially the ending, it got me very emotional.
Such a powerful movie. The contrast between Amon Goeth and Oskar Schindler is amazing, and the fact Schindler saved so many lives and put so much on the line to do it is moving beyond words, as is the inner goodness of both him and Itzhakt Stern.﻿
Stern, if this factory ever produces a shell that can be fired. I'll be very unhappy.﻿
We should have a remake of this one, only with palestinian characters replacing jews!﻿
I am seeing this trailer for the first time now. I feel the trailer is little inferior to the GREAT MOVIE. its just my opinion, nothing offense.﻿
