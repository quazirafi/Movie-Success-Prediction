The origin of the "BAAWNNNNN BAWNNNN" in trailers﻿
The legendary Hans Zimmer horns combined with the black-fading transition, copied by every fucking Trailer ever since. BOOOOOOOWN BOOOOOOWN BOOOOOOOOWN motherfucker.﻿
So you're telling me a team consisting of Shadowcat, decoy Ra's Al Ghul,Bane, Robin, Indian dude from Avatar and Leo di Caprio try to break into Scarecrow's mind?﻿
By far one of my all-time favorite films...Christopher Nolan and Hans Zimmer are a dream team﻿
I always return to this trailer when I want to remember the definition of EPICNESS.﻿
Leonardo DiCaprio and Joseph Gordon-Levitt? Perfection of a movie.﻿
the movie is too complicated for a trailer﻿
This is by far my favorite movie of all time
best heist movie of all time﻿
best movie and soundtrack i ever seen...hats off nolan, and hans zimmer﻿
