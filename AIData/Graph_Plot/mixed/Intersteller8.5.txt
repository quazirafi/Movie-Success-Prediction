Didn't have a fav movie 'til I watched this. The feels were so real...
the film describes exactly what the C.E.R.N. large hadron collider do in reality .
I've never cried so hard watching a movie as I cried watching this .. by far the best movie that I saw in the last 4 years.. 
Believe me and write somewhere what i say: This movie will define a generation of science boys. that was just the most wonderful, gorgeous and the smartest science movie i ever watch.
This movie literally blew my mind! The acting to the visual effects this is an extraordinary film that everyone HAS to watch! I loved it a lot
this is the most amazing science fiction movie i have ever seen,i cried when cooper sees his son's video growing up and breaks down really this taught me many lessons today.dont have anymore words to describe this masterpice work.it has set the benchmark for the future movies in this genre
THIS IS THE ONLY REASON I HAVE TO SIGN UP FOR AN IMDB ACCOUNT, WHY???? TO RATE THIS 10/10, I NEVER RATE A MOVIE MY WHOLE LIFE, BUT THIS ONE IS DIFFERENT, DEFINITELY THE BEST MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE
So all this trailer told me, was that a couple people go travel in space. And nothing else. Great. What's the movie about, again?
Great movie
The movie is 100 times better than this trailer
