The Best Movie I've seen for a long long time.
I can't understand how other reviewers see this as a film about the Nazis or the Holocaust. It's not!!! "Life is Beautiful" is a film about love, optimism, courage and inner strength.
Best film ever seen!!!
A superb tragi-comedy
Please see this film, and make up your own mind. It is appealing in so many different ways that I'm sure that you will not be disappointed.
Funny, entertaining, and amazingly intense and dramatic.
This is one of the best films that I have ever seen. It manages to be so encompassing that you hardly notice the subtitles are even there. I proudly cast my vote of 10.
This may be one of the best films ever made. I've never seen a movie with such a balance of hysterical comedy and serious drama. Roberto Benigni totally deserved his Oscars.
I loved this film. Loved everything about it and I am so glad that I got to see it and cheer Benigni at the Oscars. He certainly deserved his best actor award and he should have gotten more.
A satire set in a concentration camp, tough a hit internationally, was thought by some critics to be in bad taste...
