Lady and the Tramp, before animation and at the start of talkies- one of the most wonderful films ever conceived and executed
You can't go wrong with Charlie Chaplin, but City Lights is even better than Chaplin's films usually are.
A one-man virtuoso performance
"City Lights" engaged a true genius in a graceful and touching performance which arouses profound feelings and joy with great simplicity of style and tragic tale… Each scene was the result of hard-working detail and planning…
Once again Chaplin plays his famous creation, the beloved Tramp… The noble Little Fellow meets and falls in love with a blind flower girl… She assumes he is wealthy man and offers him a flower, which he attentively accepts with his last penny… 
Amusing comedy sets up SPECTACULAR ending
To me, the rest of the film exists largely to set the context for that one magnificent piece of celluloid. Yes, the boxing scene is great, and the scene where he rescues the millionaire is also wonderful, but it's that ending that makes us all love this movie.
