There will never be another film like Raiders
Raiders of the Lost Ark is the epitome of entertainment. What more can be said about it. If you haven't seen this movie in a while or if you haven't seen it at all ( gasp ) then do yourself a favour and rent it tonight. It is awesome.
As for where it ranks with Star Wars, it's hard for me to say, so I won't. Star Wars was the first film I ever saw, and there's a story in that as well. Thanks again, Dad.
It's funny, exiting, thrilling and romantic. What more can you ask for?
Excellent movie and brilliantly crafted entertainment with a superb casting
Some could argue that there could be a bit more depth or seriousness to the story, but come on, it's a ripping adventure yarn, you don't need depth.
Now there's something you cannot say about The Fast and the Furious! Sigh, where did all the special movies go?
My favorite movie of all time!
Watch this film again, it's worth it, I promise you.
"Raiders of the Lost Arc" is a perfect package of unforgettable scenes, countless action, humor, astonishing technical effects, thrilling sequences, and terrific performances.
