One of the most successful movies of all time (and I'm not talking about the Box Office take)
This movie does not rate a rating. Usually, when I say that, it is because the movie is so bad, or disappointing that I don't have the heart to rate it. 
The film that changed the world
Not to mention John Williams' wonderful score, without of it, the movie wouldn't have been this great it's a perfect mix, that's what it is!
A kid's fantasy. An Adult's memory
The greatest cinematic epic of all time begins here.
Could this BE any better? (Har. Har.)
The Best of Sci-Fi Times,the Worst of sf Times
My favourite movie
An adventure story, replacing six-shooters or swords with laser guns and horses with rockersâ€¦
