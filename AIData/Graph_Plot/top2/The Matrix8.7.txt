The story of a reluctant Christ-like protagonist set against a baroque, MTV backdrop, The Matrix is the definitive hybrid of technical wizardry and contextual excellence that should be the benchmark for all sci-fi films to come.
Immensely entertaining, intriguingly philosophical and just about one of the best films ever made!
What is the Matrix? Well, one of the best films ever, for one thing...
The Matrix...when I first heard about it, I expected just another sci-fi action thriller. Good and filled with insane stunts, but not terribly intelligent.
It's been a while since a movie has generated enough interest in me for me to watch it. "The Matrix" looked exciting enough in the trailers, so I decided to give it a look. What I found was an amazing movie, with some of the greatest special effects I've ever seen.
Raises the bar for sci-fi films for years to come
The more you watch it, the better it gets
A watershed moment in film-making â€“ and what a kick-ass masterpiece
A great epic that sets the stage for the next level in sci-fi...
There are so many great things in this movie, it is just crazy.
