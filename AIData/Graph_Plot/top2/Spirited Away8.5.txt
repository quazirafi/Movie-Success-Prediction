An Amazing Achievement in Animation.
'Spirited Away' is a simply a modern masterpiece, easily one of the Top 10 films of the new millennium.
A stunning, intoxicating, magical masterpiece.
There is simply no denying that Miyazaki is the Godfather of Japanese Animation, time and time again delivering unto the public works of such incredible beauty, such stunning visual and sensory delights, such mastery of storytelling, that one can only be left speechless. Overwhelmed. 
Mystical, engaging, wonderful!
Best animated film I have seen!
A Fantastic Film (most literally)
Another great point in fact the best part of it, is the fantastic score. It really is uplifting and very original. This is just great film making.
Outstanding animation; funny, weird, scary and touching at the same time, this unique work of art is one I can't recommend enough.
Mystical and enchanting. A key to another world.
