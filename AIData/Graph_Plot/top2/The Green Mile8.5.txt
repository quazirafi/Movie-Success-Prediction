Film was invented for creations like this.
The Green Mile should bring you joy, laughter, and if you are like most in the theater this night, tears.
As wonderful as the book!
A rare gem of casting and direction.
All in all the The Green Mile is a very touching drama, with the joys and sorrows of the life pictured with great skill, if not the best movie of the year. Five out of five.
Flawlessly shot on perfect period sets, the whole production binds together to bring the extraordinary story into the realm of a believable and compelling study of human injustice and charity.
he story to the film on the outside appears astoundingly simple, though once inside the film and into the plot, there is a lot more to the eye than what appears. Death Row in the olden days might sound like a boring setting for a film, but there are many intricate webs of storyline and a number of surprises and twists along the way, many which had me gasping aloud.
At just over 3 hours, "The Green Mile" is a little over-long, and you get the feeling a few scenes could've been cut down to make the film run a little smoother pace-wise.
Amazing and captivating rendition of the novel.
This movie just proves how much director Frank Darabont can do with such little setting.
