This movie is way to be good to be labelled a sequel to The Godfather . Rather it is more of a companion piece to the original and the two perfectly compliment each other .
The original Godfather is a brilliant work. It is in a sense a voyeuristic delight, allowing us to see the mafia from the inside - we become part of the family. 
The Godfather Part 2 is the finest sequel ever made and is arguably a finer film than the original Godfather.
Al Pacino's performance is quiet and solemn... He is cold and ruthless, with a whole contrast from the idealistic innocent war hero we initially met at the beginning of the first film...
The Godfather Part II is truly a masterpiece. Timeless, Classic, Beautiful and endlessly watchable
As close to perfection as movies get
Pacino at his best
It is almost unthinkable to watch this film without having seen The Godfather (1972) first. This is a direct continuation of that story.
The Godfather Part Two is possibly the best film ever made, every part of this film is amazing, it is even better than the original, I was very surprised by this.
To me and probably to many other people The Godfather Part II is more of a continuation than sequel to The Godfather. Just look at the IMDb rating and you'll see I'm not the only one who feels this way. To me it as good as the first.
