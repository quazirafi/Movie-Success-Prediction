How could anything be more fun than this?
Back To The Future is such an inventive and exciting piece of filmmaking that it is impossible to forget about it.
Back To The Future (1985) is my all time favourite movie.
It's a thoroughly feel good film, accessible to all ages and enjoyable from the 1st to the 45th time of watching and never fails to bring a smile.
It gets a solid 9 out of 10, comedy, fantasy, the gorgeous Lea Thompson, the insane but comic Doc and the typical teenager Marty make this film a must for all young at heart.
Let your imagination fly
Clever and humourous references litter this fun flick; references which are further improved upon in the sequels. Views of the same scenes from different angles, different perspectives and different timelines abound.
Overall, I have to praise this movie for its inventiveness and originality, even if it created most of our time-travel cliches. 4 out of 5 stars. Well worth your time.
With such an automotive obsession as this film has, one must wonder if George Lucas was involved.
