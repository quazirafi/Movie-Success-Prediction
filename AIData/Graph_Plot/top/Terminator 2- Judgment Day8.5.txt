the best action film of all time, and NOT due to the CGI
Words cannot describe the greatness of this movie
Overall, Termiantor II: Judgement Day is an absolute must see classic. If you have not seen it, buy it! Because once you have seen it, you will want to do so anyways. It is fast paced and highly enjoyable for just about every audience.
I highly recommend this movie.
The performances are memorable particularly Linda Hamilton's Sara Connor and simply put, they'll never make a better action film.
In some ways, I like the first better. But then I think about the second film and I have a hard time choosing. I suppose if I had to choose I'd choose the first film. And let me just state for the record that I'm glad I don't have to choose.
Terminator 2 is the best film I have ever seen hands down. It surpasses the original in almost every way except the first film had a darker moodier atmosphere.
"T2" was the sole-guiding factor in my life - because of it, I KNEW I wanted to make movies in any way, shape or form.
One sequel that out does the original
'Terminator 2: Judgment Day' is a blazing big-budget sci-fi thriller, very creative, to be entirely experienced... A definite must-see movie...
