Both uplifting and disheartening, sometimes both at once
It has an excellent storyline, top notch acting, painfully bleak visuals, perfectly setting the tone for the movie, and alternates between being truly uplifting to devastatingly depressing.
Touching and moving, a great cinematic experience
Poetic - Powerful - Simple: The Greatness of Cuckoo's Nest.
I have never read the book and I find it hard to believe author Ken Kesey has never watched the filmed version. Comparing a book to a movie is impossible. They are 2 distinctly different artistic methods of story-telling.
A great order vs. chaos tale that everyone can relate to
"What an excellent movie" is all that went through my mind after seeing this masterpiece
