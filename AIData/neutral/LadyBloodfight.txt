Early on the film cast Asian stars like Maggie Q and called itself Lady Bloodsport. That would have been a great movie but it didn't come as planned.
his was a very good film with girls fighting girls for once not boys i loved the story it was kind of like a female blood-sport for me and although Amy Johnston isn't the world best actress she's decent and beautiful to boot, good film i will be looking out for more from her I was expecting a rubbish movie here but really enjoyed this one
Lady Bloodfight is a movie with a heart on its right place. But it is too hard to take it seriously in this day and age. Let me tell you why.
1. The idea of redoing Bloodsport with enough estrogen to fill a swimming pool is not as goofy as it sounds. There are entire chunks of this movie where you think, hey, this is not a bad idea. And then unfortunately there are also chunks where you are thinking, OMG what were they thinking?
Terrible in every which way; rudimentary shadow of a story, amateurish acting, incompetent editing, sub-par choreography, direction.. what, you think somebody actually directed this?
