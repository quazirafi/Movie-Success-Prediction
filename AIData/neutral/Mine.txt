Lore Sjoberg, professional sarcast, years ago coined what he calls "The Law of Cinematic Inaccuracy". "Movies get everything wrong. Hacking-based movies are laughable to hackers, military-based movies are laughable to members of the armed forces, and Indiana Jones movies are laughable to archaeologists." File this one in the military category.
If you go into this expecting war action, you'll be severely disappointed. Exhibit A: the low ratings of some reviewers here.
This isn't a war movie or an action movie. It's the story of a man facing his inner demons in the context of war. I think the directors did a phenomenal job creating a true thriller with literally little action.
It was too obvious, it did not have any surprisingly turns ore twist of any kind. And the main actor is to typical American patriot, i go to war and i don't know why, i am a soldier and so on.
Critics like always slamming good films just cuz they take a different approach than what they wanted.
The films revolves around this marine who is stuck in a land mine and while there is not much to do on that situation, the film follows along with the metaphor of "Man stuck on his own path" and he needs to learn to move on.
This movie is actually not that terrible. It is full of inaccuracies, mistakes and failures - but this seems to be quite common these days. I see not a big problem here.
The fundamental problem is insane, excruciating boredom of it.
Trained sniper won't fire because it's a wedding, 
Trained sniper given away by lense flare, 
Walking through the desert no hats, 
Poorly conceived, very badly written movie. You can switch of the movie after the first 15 minutes. The only saving grace is the hero. Looks very handsome. 
not much to gain from watching this.
in fact watching paint dry is so much more giving.
it has its obvious faults see goofs and other one star review of this.
