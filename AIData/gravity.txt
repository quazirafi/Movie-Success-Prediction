superb
Great movie! This is movie that makes me feel like out of oxygen in my house
Omg, I must see this movie!
Litterly the best movie ever
Just watched it 3/10. It's a terrible movie! the effects are good the script is terrible and it's without doubt the most unrealistic movie I've ever seen. The fire extinguisher bit brings the Lolz, when uses the thrust of the extinguisher in mid space to get into the pod, is truly ridiculous, even for Hollywood standards.
Absolutely a brilliant movie!! I really don't understand how people in previous comments could have such negative feedbacks about this movie. It made me cry so much and made me think of my life, how we have to keep going, go on living no matter what circumstances. That part where Matt suddenly showed up and taught Ryan the story of life (in Ryan's imagination) makes me cry sooo much. One guy on youtube rated this movie number one to watch of 2013 movies and I can't agree more.
It is a great movie, it is what Sunshine should have been.
Good Movie 2 watch ,its true happening when you up in the space and its not easy to return back to the earth
Amazing movie! Watched it last night, on the premiere here in Denmark. One of the best space-movies of all time
Best drama movie ever 10/10
