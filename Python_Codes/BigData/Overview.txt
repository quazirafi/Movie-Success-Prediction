1. First used the twitter dataset
2. Then used the IMDB movie review dataset prepared by Stanford University NLP group
3. Used that dataset to train the model to differentiate between positive and negative comments
4. Used tf-idf scores of unigrams and bigrams as the main features after removing stopwords
5. Then sort the whole feature vector according to tf-idf score and select the best 100000 features
6. Then used SVM with RBF kernel to classify the test comments
7. Previous approach was SVM with linear kernel
8. We achieved 89.52% accuracy for 50/50 and 90.41% accuracy for 90/10 which is actually better than previous approaches
9. Then we have combined our feature selection with Nanyang Technological University's paper where they have generated a polarity score for each of the 
   comments and used that as a feature in SVM(Linear)
10. But using that technique our accuracy decreases to 75.90%
11. Then we separated polarity score from SVM and use polarity score separately to classify using the mean polarity
12. But accuracy also doesn't improve in this case
