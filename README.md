# Movie Success Prediction using Public Sentiment Analysis
Given user reviews or comments regarding a movie the system predicts whether the movie will be a hit or flop. The system uses a mixture of machine
learning model and statistical data analysis to find the percentage of positive and negative comments to
predict the fate of the movie. This project was developed as part of the Artificial Intelligence Lab course
(CSE-434).
